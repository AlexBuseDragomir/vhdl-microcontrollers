# MIPS32 Processor (VHDL Implementation)

This repository contains a MIPS32 processor implemented in VHDL as part of the Computer Structure and Organisation course.

## Project Overview

This project aimed to design and implement a functional MIPS32 processor using VHDL.   
The implementation adheres to the MIPS32 architecture specifications and utilizes concepts learned throughout the Computer Structure and Organization course.
