# vhdl-microcontrollers

This repository contains VHDL implementations for the PIC24 and MIPS32 microcontrollers. These projects were developed during my studies at the Faculty of Computer Science.

## Microcontroller Overview

### PIC24

The PIC24 is a family of 16-bit microcontrollers by Microchip Technology. They are known for their performance, low power consumption, and rich peripheral set, making them suitable for a wide range of embedded applications.

* **Key Features:**
    * 16-bit Harvard architecture
    * Modified RISC instruction set
    * Variety of integrated peripherals (e.g., ADC, DAC, timers, UART)
    * Wide operating voltage range

### MIPS32

MIPS32 is a 32-bit RISC instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by MIPS Technologies.  It's widely used in embedded systems, particularly in networking equipment and game consoles.

* **Key Features:**
    * 32-bit architecture with a large register file
    * Load-store architecture
    * Simple and efficient instruction set
    * Support for pipelining and other performance-enhancing techniques

## Projects

* **PIC24:** This project implements a basic PIC24 microcontroller core in VHDL, including essential components like the ALU, control unit, and register file.
* **MIPS32:** This project implements a MIPS32 microcontroller in VHDL, showcasing a more complex architecture with pipelining and memory management features.

## Purpose

These projects serve as educational examples of how to design and implement microcontrollers using VHDL. They demonstrate the fundamental principles of computer architecture and hardware design.
